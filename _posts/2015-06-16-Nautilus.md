Just finished animating a nautilus for an interactive underwater landscape I've been working on as a portfolio piece. Full size after the break.

<span class="more"></span>

This was the first time I've used photoshop for animation and I'm pretty happy with the final result. It took me way longer than it would have in flash but I was able to match the art style I've been using in the rest of the project. In the future I'll likely start off in flash to get the motions right, then export to photoshop for retouching.
