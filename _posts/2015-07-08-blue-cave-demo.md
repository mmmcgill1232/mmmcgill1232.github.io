Progress! I've finally got this environment to a point where I'm happy demoing it. It's far from finished but I really like how it's looking now.

This zone is part of a large underground cave area with a variety of coloured glowing mushrooms. Each colour has it's own sub-zone and each contains a recipe for a glow potion of the same colour.
