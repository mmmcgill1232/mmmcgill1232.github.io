More animation for the underwater landscape.

<span class="more"></span>

I started off doing a bunch of sketching in flash until I got a motion I was happy with for one strand. Then I duplicated it, pivoted the clones, and offset the starting frame for each strand. This technique allowed me to get compelling movement without having to draw multiple unique cycles. 

Once I had the motion right I exported each layer as a png sequence and used photoshop's video layer from file feature to import it. In photoshop I recoloured and shaded the strands to match the art style I've been using. While recolouring I made use of photoshop actions for the first time. Making changes to a frame of a video layer doesn't alter the other frames so if you want a universal change there's a lot of repetition involved. I was able to create actions that simplified a roughly 30 second task (that I'd have to do about 60 times) into two button presses.
