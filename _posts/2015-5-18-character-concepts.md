I've been trying out caricature style for my character designs and I'm quite pleased with how some of them have turned out.

Currently I'm planning on having these guys function as builders, allowing the player to purchase environment upgrades throughout the game.

I love how this guy turned out. He's likely going to serve as the initiating force for the adventure and be a source of problems for the player.
