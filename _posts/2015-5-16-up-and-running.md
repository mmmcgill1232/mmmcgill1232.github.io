And how better to get started than with the first draft of my main character's running animation!

It got pretty chopped up somewhere in the upload process. You can see how it looks in game [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fY_7IBOS1Tw).

This was my first real try at animation and I'm pretty happy with the result. The motion may need a few tweaks still but I think I'm pretty close to being able to re-skin it into somthing less grey.

[Happy Harry's tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjX9SJKrPnPROi_Bc3LOBWaXi0uz61Bom) were invaluable for learning the basics. If you're interested in giving animation a try I highly recommend them as a starting point.
